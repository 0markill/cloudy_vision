# Cloudy Vision: Computer Vision API Explorer

Several companies offer APIs for image recognition, e.g., given an image of a day at the park, they will return tags indicating that the image contains a dog, park bench, frisbee, and even any detected faces, their ages, and genders. 

Cloudy Vision is a script that allows you to take a folder full of images, and see what results you get from a variety of these survices. The intended use is for anyone interested in these APIs, to be able to upload their corpus of images and get a *qualitative* feel for what the results look like across vendors. More details are available in this blog post.
